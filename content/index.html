My favorite song is right now is As It Was by Harry Styles.. these are the lyrics...Holdin' me back Gravity's holdin' me backI want you to hold out the palm of your hand Why don't we leave it at that? Nothin' to say When everything gets in the way Seems you cannot be replaced And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh [Chorus] In this world, it's just us You know it's not the same as it was In this world, it's just usYou know it's not the same as it was As it was, as it was You know it's not the same
